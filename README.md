# Instruction 
###   ✅ Create a table (DataFrame) within your own group information.
###   ✅ Add new students to the table, including your own group members.
###   ✅ Add a new column that shows each student’s hobby.
###   ✅ Print the full table to see all your data together!
### Challenge 1: Add another group member
### Example:
df.loc[len(df)] = ['YourName', 15, 'English', 'Photography']

### Challenge 2: Add another column for “Favorite Snack”
### Example:
df['Favorite_Snack'] = ['Chips', 'Apples', 'Cookies', 'Pizza', 'Banana']

### Challenge 3: Print only one column
### Example:
print(df['Hobby'])

### Challenge 4: Save your group table as a CSV file (like a mini-database!)
### Example:
df.to_csv('group_students.csv', index=False)
# analyze the datasets and tell something you found interesting to learn about your group member
